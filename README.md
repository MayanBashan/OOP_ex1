## README
This task is a development of a data structure of an *undirected *weighted graph.
The graph was realized by using HashMap data structure, and the operations were written by realizing BFS algorithm (please see explanation in the algorithm itself).
Included methods: find shortest path and its distance, add or remove vertices and edges, deep copy cunstructor, etc.

Definitions
 * *undirected graph - each edge can be traversed in either direction*
 * *weighted graph - edges have weight*
